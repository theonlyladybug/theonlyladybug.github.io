I am a PhD student in the [Visualization & Interface Design Innovation (VIDI) Lab](https://vidi.cs.ucdavis.edu/) at the the University of California - Davis, USA. Prior to my PhD study, I obtained a bachelor degree in Mathematics from the Zhejiang University.

My research is centered on the intersection of Explainable AI (XAI) and Visual Analytics (VA). I specialize in devising advanced interpretation methodologies to enhance the understanding, evaluation, and diagnosis of AI systems. Additionally, I engineer sophisticated visualization systems to further augment and streamline the interpretation and analytical processes.

<!-- My research is focused on advancing hardware-accelerated, machine-learning-augmented visualization techniques to support complex, large-scale scientific applications. Specifically, I design hardware-accelerated parallel algorithms that facilitate realistic visualization of scientific data and create innovative methods for efficiently managing large-scale, distributed data.  I also develop expressive and intelligent systems that optimize and automate scientific visualization and analysis processes, ultimately paving the way for more streamlined workflows and fostering scientific breakthroughs. -->
