I am a PhD student in the Visualization & Interface Design Innovation Lab at the the University of California - Davis, USA. Prior to my PhD study, I obtained a computer graphics master degree from the University of Utah and a physics bachelor degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

My research is focused on advancing hardware-accelerated, machine-learning-augmented visualization techniques to support complex, large-scale scientific applications. Specifically, I design hardware-accelerated parallel algorithms that facilitate realistic visualization of scientific data and create innovative methods for efficiently managing large-scale, distributed data.  I also develop expressive and intelligent systems that optimize and automate scientific visualization and analysis processes, ultimately paving the way for more streamlined workflows and fostering scientific breakthroughs.
