I am a PhD in the Visualization & Interface Design Innovation Lab at the the University of California - Davis, USA. Prior to his PhD, I obtained a computer graphicsmaster degree from University of Utah and a physics bachelor from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

My research involves various high performance visualization techniques, such as parallel rendering, distributed rendering, real-time GPU/CPU ray tracing, out-of-core streaming, etc. Recently, I am also working on other areas such as programming language and deep learning.
