I am a PhD in the Visualization & Interface Design Innovation Lab at the the University of California - Davis, USA. Prior to my PhD, I obtained a computer graphicsmaster degree from University of Utah and a physics bachelor from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

My research is focused on advancing software-defined, machine-learning-augmented visualization techniques to tackle complex, large-scale scientific problems. Specifically, I design hardware-accelerated parallel algorithms that facilitate realistic visualizations of scientific data. I create innovative methods for efficiently managing large-scale data and distributed data by integrating neural network representations. I also develop expressive and intelligent systems that optimize and automate scientific visualization and analysis processes, ultimately paving the way for more streamlined workflows and fostering scientific breakthroughs.
