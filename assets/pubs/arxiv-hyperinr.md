<figcaption align = "center">Figure 2: The architecture of HyperINR. HyperINR is composed of a shared MLP denoted as S and a collection of multiresolution hash encoding parameters E, with each parameter associated with a set of values {a,b,c,...}. A) In high dimensions, a KD-tree is utilized, B) while in 1D, the encoding parameters are arranged in a linear array. C) The input parameter q is utilized to query the data structure, and the queried encoding parameters are interpolated and combined with the shared MLP to construct an INR. The resulting INR enables interactive visualization and real-time parameter exploration.</figcaption>
