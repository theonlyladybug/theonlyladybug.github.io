abstract: "Recent advancements in pre-trained large-scale language-image models have ushered in a new era of visual comprehension, offering a significant leap forward. These breakthroughs have proven particularly instrumental in addressing long-standing challenges that were previously daunting. Leveraging these innovative techniques, this paper tackles two well-known issues within the realm of visual analytics: (1) the efficient exploration of large-scale image datasets and identification of potential data biases within them; (2) the evaluation of image captions and steering of their generation process. On the one hand, by visually examining the captions automatically generated from language-image models for an image dataset, we gain deeper insights into the semantic underpinnings of the visual contents, unearthing data biases that may be entrenched within the dataset. On the other hand, by depicting the association between visual contents and textual captions, we expose the weaknesses of pre-trained language-image models in their captioning capability and propose an interactive interface to steer caption generation. The two parts have been coalesced into a coordinated visual analytics system, fostering mutual enrichment of visual and textual elements. We validate the effectiveness of the system with domain practitioners through concrete case studies with large-scale image datasets."

teaser_caption: "Our system contains three main views. (a) The Co-Occurrence Graph employs a node-link diagram to present the dominant and co-occurred features of an image dataset. (b) The Image Segment view uses a scatterplot to lay out image segments and color them based on the attention they received. (c) The  view provides an interface to steer the caption generation process."
